This module contains some Mixin classes for the db objects.

A bunch of functions on the db objects are really more like
"utility functions": They could live outside the classes
and be called "by hand" passing the appropiate reference.
They usually only use the public API of the object and
rarely use database related stuff.

These functions now live here and get "mixed in" into the
real objects.

        This one does not *force* slugs, but usually it will probably result
        in a niceish one.

        The end *result* of the algorithm will result in these resolutions for
        these situations:
         - If we have a slug, make sure it's clean and sanitized, and if it's
           unique, we'll use that.

         - If we can't get any sort of thing that looks like it'll be a useful
           slug out of a title or an existing slug, bail, and don't set the
           slug at all.  Don't try to create something just because.  Make
           sure we have a reasonable basis for a slug first.
         - If we have a reasonable basis for a slug (either based on existing
           slug or slugified title) but it's not unique, first try appending
           the entry's id, if that exists
         - If that doesn't result in something unique, tack on some randomly
           generated bits until it's unique.  That'll be a little bit of junk,
